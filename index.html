        <p class="about-text"> Hello! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Daniel Hackworth. I'm 26 years old, originally from Redding, Connecticut. I earned my Associate of Science degree in Horticulture from the Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Beyond my professional life, I enjoy Renaissance fairs with my fiancée, crafting costumes, and spending time with my dog, Kali. Cooking and fitness are also among my passions.

            Kali, my spirited all-black Doberdor, adds joy to my life with her lively and affectionate nature.
            
            For the past two years, I've been a dedicated dog walker and pet sitter. However, I'm now on the cusp of an exciting transition as I prepare for marriage and starting a family. This motivates me to explore new career paths that align with my aspirations.
            
            My previous role as a dog walker helped me transition after my release from incarceration, a chapter that profoundly reshaped my perspective and fostered personal growth. Embracing this experience, I've matured and committed myself to achieving my goals.
            
            My coding journey began gradually. In high school, I explored programming and even captained the robotics team. However, the real turning point came later when I faced a challenge – managing bookkeeping while battling Lyme disease. This inspired me to create a program that could simplify tasks. Seeking guidance from friends in computer science, I embarked on a mission to bring my vision to life.
            
            My first coding success was a comprehensive bookkeeping program crafted with JavaScript and Google Apps Script, featuring integrated APIs. This ignited my passion, leading to personal Python projects. Currently, I'm engrossed in developing a 2D RPG game using Pygame, focusing on coding enemy AI from scratch. As well as, web design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            
            My journey led me to the Flatiron School, recommended by a friend who also overcame legal challenges. Now, as a software engineering student, I'm excited to explore more coding and possible avenues for a career. Currently, my enthusiasm lies in crafting AI algorithms, and I'm eager to discover where my unique skills can make a valuable contribution to any team.
