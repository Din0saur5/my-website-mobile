        <p class="portfolio-text"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my projects can be found on github, username Din0saur5. Click the icons at the bottom of the page see my repositories or my resume!<br><br>
        Personal and group projects I have worked on include:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.5;"><li style="padding: 5px;">A book keeping program that uses google calander API to gather my events for the day, sorts them by duration and catagorizes them in a spread sheet and accesses a local address book to send encrypted address data to mapquest through their API to get how many miles travelled. Using and recording this information it calculated how much I was paid and my mileage expenses.(Google App Scrips) (Not on git hub)<br></li>
            <li style="padding: 5px;">A seperate web page styled after a space ship HUD with cool page transitions.<br></li>
            <li style="padding: 5px;">My big project, that may never truely be finished as it has the potential to be added to indefinitely, a 2D rpg game in python. Inspired by D&D, this game features all sorts of graphics in pygame. Ever expanding game mechanics and my own custom enemy AI computer model.
        This AI was built completely from scratch and at its base uses a modified A* algorithm for movement. I have also integrated what I coin as "behavioral" and "tactical" algorithms that use a set of variables tagged to different kinds of enemies. These AI algorithms all work in tandem to create a varied and unique fighting style for a myriad of creatures with an endless possibility for special or magic abilities. I am very proud of this model so feel free to get me talking about it, I'll talk your ear off.<br></li>       
            <li style="padding: 5px;">Using OpenLibrary's public api to make a book finder and estimate reading time calculator. This project utilizes html, css, and js. Notably, event listeners, fetch requests from external api with proper data variation handling 
                and persistant data storage using (fetch-based) get, post, and delete requests on a local json-server <br></li>
